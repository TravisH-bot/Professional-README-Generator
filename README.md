# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

- What was your motivation?

  The motivation behind the project was to generate a README file based on user answers to a prompt within the terminal.

- Why did you build this project?

  The project was created to test what was learned in the lessons and projects learned up to this point, with an emphasis on Node.js, ES6 syntax, template literals, and NPM.

- What problem does it solve?

  The problem this project solves is the ability to generate a README file based on answers to a prompt. This allows for time to be saved when creating future projects.

- What did you learn?

  During this project, I have learned how to accurately use node.js, template literals to inject formatting into a file, and linking two js files together with the use of exporting.

I have also learned how to incorporate shields.io into my projects README.

## Credits

Most of the project was created with the aid of the previous lessons and the mini-project leading up to the challenge.

I used a tutorial found on [medium.com](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-make-custom-language-badges-for-your-profile-using-shields-io-d2aeaf016b6b) to help learn the formatting to add the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) badges as well as the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) site as well.

Badges are used in the generation of the README file itself and one for demonstration here.
